#### **Volunteer Project 2: Leadership Coaching Course Feedback Analysis**

# Project Overview
As part of my volunteer work at MIND (Mentoring in New Dimensions), I conducted a comprehensive data analysis for a Leadership Coaching Course. The analysis focused on feedback collected from participants over eight weeks, with the goal of providing actionable insights to improve course quality, trainer performance, and participants' overall learning experience. The data was visualized using an interactive dashboard.

## Objectives 
Course Dashboard Objectives:  
1. Identify trends in course and trainer ratings over the eight-week period.  
2. Analyze participants' feedback to recognize areas of improvement and strengths in course delivery.  
3. Explore participants' future course preferences and interest fields for targeted program design.  
4. Highlight actionable feedback for trainers and facilitators to enhance participant satisfaction.

## Data Description
The dataset for this analysis captures valuable information on participants' feedback and preferences throughout the eight-week Leadership Coaching Course. Key attributes include:  
• **week_number**: Indicates the week of the course for tracking trends over time.  
• **trainer's_name**: Identifies trainers to evaluate individual performance.  
• **training_title**: Provides the topic or theme of each session to assess interest areas.  
• **course_rating**: Reflects participants' overall satisfaction with the course.  
• **trainer_rating**: Rates trainers' performance, helping to identify top performers.  
• **feedback_trainer**: Captures qualitative feedback on trainers, offering insights into areas for improvement.  
• **courses_like_this (Yes/No/Maybe)**: Gauges participants' interest in similar courses for future planning.  
• **any_comment_for_course**: Includes specific suggestions or observations about the course.  
• **possibility_joining_future_courses**: Measures participants' likelihood of rejoining, aiding retention strategies.  
• **participants'_future_courses_specifications**: Details topics or areas participants wish to see in future courses.  
• **participants'_interest_of_field**: Highlights participants' professional or academic interests, guiding content development.  
• **feedback_facilitator**: Evaluates facilitators' performance and engagement skills.

This dataset enables an in-depth analysis of participant satisfaction, trainer effectiveness, and preferences, which are critical for enhancing the quality and relevance of future courses.
